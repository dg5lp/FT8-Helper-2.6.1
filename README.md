# FT8-Helper-2.6.1
Important note!

When downloading the exe file, virus-alarm might occur. This is a false alarm. The FT8-Helper software use macro commands. Most virus checker cannot distinguish harmless and harmful macros, althought they are not encrypted. Upload and check the software to virustotal.com. You can trust the software. Another issue: The dxcc_qra.txt can be downloaded via copy-paste to a notepad, or together with the exe in the ZIP-file.

==========================================================================

The FT8-Helper program was developed as macro extension for the JTDX using the Quick-Macros program. Comparing to other FT8-Robot programs, the FT8-Helper is more “intelligent”, it interprets the received messages of WSJTX and acts according to the own pre-programmed QSO strategy. The delivered EXE file contains the licence for Quick-Macros.
